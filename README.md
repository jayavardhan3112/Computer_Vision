### Description
- Optical flow is a computer vision technique used to track the motion of objects in an image or video sequence. It involves computing the motion vectors of points in consecutive frames and using them to estimate the motion of the objects. Optical flow is widely used in various applications, such as motion analysis, video compression, and object tracking.
- In a computer vision repository, object tracking using optical flow involves implementing and testing different optical flow algorithms for tracking objects in videos. The repository may contain various implementations of optical flow algorithms, such as Lucas-Kanade, Farneback, and Horn-Schunck, and provide benchmarks for comparing their performance. It may also include object detection and feature extraction techniques, as well as machine learning approaches for object tracking. The goal of the repository is to provide researchers and practitioners with a set of tools and resources for developing and evaluating object tracking systems using optical flow.
